I worked  a new logo design for the Commitlabs organization.



Unique, modern logo representing Commitlabs' identity.
Works well on both light and dark backgrounds.
Provide color palette and font/typography suggestions.
Deliverables: SVG (vector) and PNG (transparent background) at multiple sizes (favicon, 128px, 512px).
Provide usage examples (dark/light backgrounds, favicon, app icon).
